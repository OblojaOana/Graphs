# Graphs
1. I added to the App.js file - Apollo client
2. I created a new file in which I added my query, functions, constants and the graph
3. In the Graph.js file I created the functions for filtering the posts from 2019, then I processed the data so that I could send them on through prop
4. In the GraphDesign file I used VISX graphs

The most important challenge I faced was that of processing the data to build the diagram
